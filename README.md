## Domain Problem

```
We have a sample web application to dynamically generate questions based on entered
template, names, numbers and objects.
Sample question template:
The cost of #num1 identical #obj1 and #num2 identical #obj2 is $#num3.
The cost of #num4 identical #obj1 and #num5 identical #obj2 is $#num6.
What is the cost of 1 such #obj2?

Sample question generated by the web application:
The cost of 3 identical blouses and 4 identical skirts is $338.
The cost of 6 identical blouses and 1 identical skirt is $305.
What is the cost of 1 such skirt?

Can you replicate this web application using Laravel
```

## Solutions

I created a page that provides a textarea to filled with a string like example
above, then i created a vue's component to parse the content to get all needed
variables.

Code snippets to extract variables from textarea's content:

```
function findVariables(text) {
    const words = text.split(' ');
    const vars = words.filter(word => word.charAt(0) === '#');
    return vars.unique();
}
```
